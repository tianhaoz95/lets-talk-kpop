천사 같은 Hi 끝엔 악마 같은 Bye

> After a sweet hi, there’s always a bitter bye

매번 미칠듯한 High 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 Price

> After every crazy high, there’s price you have to pay

이건 답이 없는 Test 매번 속더라도 Yes

> There’s no answer to this, test I’ll always fall for it yes

딱한 감정의 노예

> I’m a slave to my emotions

얼어 죽을 사랑해

> Screw this heartless love

---

Here I come kick in the door

가장 독한 걸로 줘

> Give me the strongest one

뻔하디 뻔한 그 love

> So obvious, that love

더 내놔봐 give me some more

> Give me more, give me some more

알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에

> Cling onto the edge of the cliff if you want

한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해

> With just one word you’re like starstruck again

그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이

> That warm nervous feeling, extreme excitement

마치 heaven 같겠지만 You might not get it in

> Felt like heaven, but you might not get it in

---

Look at me Look at you 누가 더 아플까

> Look at me, look at you who will be in more pain?

You smart 누가 You are

> You smart like who? You are

두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면

> If you cry tears of blood from both eyes

So sorry 누가 You are

> So sorry like who? You are

나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어

> What should I do, I can’t stand myself being so weak

애써 두 눈을 가린 채

> While I force myself to cover my eyes

사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

> I need to bring an end to This Love

Let's kill this love!

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Let's kill this love!

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Feelin’ like a sinner

Its so fire with him I go boo hoo

He said you look crazy

Thank you baby

I owe it all to you

Got me all messed up

His love is my favorite

But you plus me

Sadly can be dangerous

---

Lucky me, lucky you

결국엔 거짓말 we lie

> After all, in the end we lie

So what so what

만약에 내가 널 지우게

> If I end up forgetting you

된다면 So sorry

I’m not sorry

나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어

> What should I do, I can’t stand myself being so weak

애써 눈물을 감춘 채

> While I force myself to hide my tears

사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

> I need to bring an end to This Love

We all commit to love

That makes you cry

We’re all making love

That kills you inside

We must kill this love

Yeah, it's sad but true

Gotta kill this love

Before it kills you too

Kill this love

Yeah, it's sad but true

Gotta kill this love

Let's kill this love!
